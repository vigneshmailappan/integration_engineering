# üåê Cloud-Native Integration Project: Full SDLC Learning Plan

**Goal**: Build a cloud-native, end-to-end integration project on Microsoft Azure using Node.js, Terraform, GitHub Actions, and Azure Logic Apps. The project will consume a free public API (REST Countries) to demonstrate real-world orchestration, automation, and CI/CD workflows. This plan also simulates the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) for hands-on project management experience.
